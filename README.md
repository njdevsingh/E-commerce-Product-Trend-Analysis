This project focuses on extracting insights from an e-commerce sales dataset through visual analytics and data exploration. Using Python's **Plotly** library, I built interactive and insightful visualizations to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities in sales and profit performance.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to perform comprehensive data and business analysis to support strategic decisions across sales, profit, customer segments, product categories, and regional performance.
